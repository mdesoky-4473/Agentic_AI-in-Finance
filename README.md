# Agentiv_AI-in-Finance
First AgenticAI project in financial technology! 

I’ve successfully built my first Agentive AI application for financial agents and seamlessly integrated it with the PhiData platform. This application leverages the power of Groq AI Interface, enabling fast and free API keys for LLMs to supercharge the development process. 💡

🔍 The application features two specialized agents:
1️⃣ WebSearch Agent using DuckDuckGo – Allows the agent to search the web for real-time information efficiently.
2️⃣ Finance Tools powered by YFinance – Provides access to stock data, financial information, and more from Yahoo Finance. 📈

This combination of tools brings enhanced capabilities to financial professionals, making data-driven decisions faster and more accessible than ever!
